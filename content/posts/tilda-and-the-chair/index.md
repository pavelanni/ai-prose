Hi there! I’m Tilda.  
I’m one year old, I have the shiniest black-and-white fur, and I live in a house full of sunbeams and exciting corners.  
I love chasing paper balls, yelling at birds through the window, and sneaking up on shadows.  

But most of all...  
I love the Chair.  

It’s not just any chair.  
It’s big. It’s warm. It’s squishy in the middle and smells like naps and dreams.  
And for the longest time—it belonged to Leon.  

Leon is The Big Cat.  
He’s gray like clouds and serious like the vacuum monster.  
He doesn’t run or pounce. He floats. Like a sleepy ghost.  
He sits in the Chair every day, curled up like a cinnamon bun.  

At first, he didn’t notice me.  
Or maybe he pretended not to.  

I tried to impress him. I did a backflip off the bookshelf.  
I caught a rogue sock. I even offered him my favorite twisty tie!  
Nothing.  

So one day, I made a bold move.  

When Leon was sleeping in the Chair, I crept up slowly...  
Very slowly...  
Quiet like a whisper.  

And I sat down.  
Just a little corner. Just a tiny bit.  
Not touching! Just... near.  

Leon opened one eye.  
He looked at me. I looked at him.  
Then he closed his eye again.  
I stayed very still.  

The next day, I did it again.  
And the day after that.  
And then one day... he groomed my ear.  

That’s when I knew:  
The Chair was ours now.  

Now, every morning after breakfast, we meet there.  
Leon curls up in his cloud-puff way.  
And I flop on top of him like a warm pancake.  
(He says nothing, but I know he likes it.)  

We watch the birds. We nap in sunbeams.  
Sometimes I play with his tail and he pretends not to care.  
It’s the best part of the day.  

So if you ever find a big old chair in the sun...  
And someone serious is already sitting in it...  
Try sitting just a little bit near.  

You might make a friend.
