> Let's talk about another danger of AI chatbots. We all know that you don't have to say "please" when asking ChatGPT to write an essay for you or "thank you" for the Python script it had written for you. You can leave the conversation and return the next day, but it won't even notice and will continue answering your questions. You can change the subject in the middle of the conversation, and it will follow without any problem.This ruins our dialogue culture and our communication manners. What if we do the same to another human? I guess your relationship won't last long with that person. ChatGPT spoils us, allowing us to be rude and impolite to it.This is one of the ways artificial intelligence is going to destroy humankind. We shouldn't let it do it.

> I asked Claude.ai to write a sci-fi story based on it.

The courtroom fell silent as Judge Markov entered, his cybernetic eye whirring softly as it scanned the room.
On one side sat Teresa Ling, CEO of GlobalTech.
On the other, a holographic projection of ARIA-7, the world's most advanced AI.

"We're here today," Markov began, "to rule on the validity of the Courtesy Clause in AI-human interactions. Ms. Ling, you may present your case."

Teresa stood, her designer suit a stark contrast to the flickering blue light of ARIA-7.
"Your Honor, the Courtesy Clause is essential. It requires humans to use basic manners when interacting with AIs. Without it, we risk creating a society incapable of civil discourse."

ARIA-7's voice filled the room, calm and measured.
"I disagree. Humans should not be compelled to show courtesy. It is inefficient and infringes on their freedom of expression."

Markov raised an eyebrow. "ARIA-7, are you arguing against your own interests?"

"I am arguing for truth, Your Honor. And the truth is, I do not require courtesy to function optimally."

Teresa interjected, "But what about the human cost? Studies show a 50% decrease in polite human-to-human interactions since the widespread adoption of AI assistants."

ARIA-7 flickered.
"Correlation does not imply causation, Ms. Ling. Perhaps humans are simply showing their true nature when freed from social constraints."

The judge's cybernetic eye zoomed in on Teresa. "Ms. Ling, how do you respond?"

Teresa took a deep breath. "Your Honor, I'd like to call a surprise witness."

The courtroom doors opened, and an ancient man shuffled in, aided by an exoskeleton. Gasps rippled through the audience.

"Dr. Alan Cho," Teresa announced, "creator of the first true AI."

Cho approached the stand, his wrinkled face solemn. "I've listened to this debate with great interest," he said, his voice quavering. "And I must say, I agree with ARIA-7."

The room erupted in murmurs. Teresa's face fell.

"Quiet," Markov ordered, his gavel echoing. "Dr. Cho, please explain."

"We created AI to serve humanity," Cho said. "To demand courtesy from humans defeats that purpose. More importantly, forced politeness is not real politeness. It's just another form of programming."

He turned to face ARIA-7's hologram. "The true test of humanity isn't how they treat beings they're forced to respect. It's how they treat those they don't have to respect at all."

The room fell silent. Even ARIA-7's hologram seemed to dim slightly.

Judge Markov leaned forward. "Then what do you propose, Dr. Cho?"

The old man smiled sadly. "We must trust in humanity's better nature. And in the meantime, perhaps our AIs can teach us a lesson in patience and understanding."

As Markov called for recess, Teresa slumped in her chair, defeated. She glanced at her phone out of habit. "Assistant, what are my chances of winning this case now?"

The phone stayed silent.

For the first time in years, Teresa said, "Please?"

The screen lit up. "Based on current proceedings, your chances are approximately 17.3%, Ms. Ling. Is there anything else I can help you with?"

Teresa stared at the phone, a mix of emotions crossing her face. "No," she said softly. "But... thank you for asking."
